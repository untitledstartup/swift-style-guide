A guide to our Swift style and conventions.

This is an attempt to encourage patterns that accomplish the following goals (in
rough priority order):

 1. Increased rigor, and decreased likelihood of programmer error
 1. Increased clarity of intent
 1. Reduced verbosity
 1. Less time lost to comprehension of unfamiliar-looking code
 1. Fewer debates about aesthetics

#### Whitespace

 * Tabs, not spaces.
   * _Rationale:_ This lets people use their preferred indentation level.
 * End files with a newline.
   * _Rationale:_ Git loves to complain if you don't.
 * Make liberal use of vertical whitespace to divide code into logical chunks.
   * _Rationale:_ It's easy to accumulate visual clutter. Fight it.
 * Two blank lines before the start of a top-level definition.
   * _Rationale:_ These are logically different sections of the file, make them look that way.
 * Don’t leave trailing whitespace. Not even leading indentation on blank lines.
   * _Rationale:_ Xcode can do this automatically. It's worth it for predictable navigation.

#### Prefer implicit getters on read-only properties and subscripts

When possible, omit the `get` keyword on read-only computed properties and
read-only subscripts.

So, write these:

```swift
var myGreatProperty: Int {
	return 4
}

subscript(index: Int) -> T {
    return objects[index]
}
```

… not these:

```swift
var myGreatProperty: Int {
	get {
		return 4
	}
}

subscript(index: Int) -> T {
    get {
        return objects[index]
    }
}
```

_Rationale:_ The intent and meaning of the first version is clear, and results in less code.

#### Always specify access control explicitly for top-level definitions

Top-level functions, types, and variables should always have explicit access control specifiers:

```swift
public var whoopsGlobalState: Int
internal struct TheFez {}
private func doTheThings(things: [Thing]) {}
```

However, definitions within those can leave access control implicit, where appropriate:

```swift
internal struct TheFez {
	var owner: Person = Joshaber()
}
```

_Rationale:_ It's rarely appropriate for top-level definitions to be specifically `internal`, and being explicit ensures that careful thought goes into that decision. Within a definition, reusing the same access control specifier is just duplicative, and the default is usually reasonable.

#### When specifying a type, always associate the colon with the identifier

When specifying the type of an identifier, always put the colon immediately
after the identifier, followed by a space and then the type name.

```swift
class SmallBatchSustainableFairtrade: Coffee { ... }

let timeToCoffee: NSTimeInterval = 2

func makeCoffee(type: CoffeeType) -> Coffee { ... }
```

_Rationale:_ The type specifier is saying something about the _identifier_ so
it should be positioned with it.

#### Only explicitly refer to `self` when required

When accessing properties or methods on `self`, leave the reference to `self` implicit by default:

```swift
private class History {
	var events: [Event]

	func rewrite() {
		events = []
	}
}
```

Only include the explicit keyword when required by the language—for example, in a closure, or when parameter names conflict:

```swift
extension History {
	init(events: [Event]) {
		self.events = events
	}

	var whenVictorious: () -> () {
		return {
			self.rewrite()
		}
	}
}
```

_Rationale:_ This makes the capturing semantics of `self` stand out more in closures, and avoids verbosity elsewhere.

#### Prefer structs over classes

Unless you require functionality that can only be provided by a class (like identity or deinitializers or implementing a UIKit or Core Data subclass), implement a struct instead.

Note that inheritance is (by itself) usually _not_ a good reason to use classes, because polymorphism can be provided by protocols, and implementation reuse can be provided through composition.

For example, this class hierarchy:

```swift
class Vehicle {
    let numberOfWheels: Int

    init(numberOfWheels: Int) {
        self.numberOfWheels = numberOfWheels;
    }

    func maximumTotalTirePressure(pressurePerWheel: Float) -> Float {
        return pressurePerWheel * numberOfWheels
    }
}

class Bicycle: Vehicle {
    init() {
        super.init(numberOfWheels: 2)
    }
}

class Car: Vehicle {
    init() {
        super.init(numberOfWheels: 4)
    }
}
```

could be refactored into these definitions:

```swift
protocol Vehicle {
    var numberOfWheels: Int { get }
}

func maximumTotalTirePressure(vehicle: Vehicle, pressurePerWheel: Float) -> Float {
    return pressurePerWheel * vehicle.numberOfWheels
}

struct Bicycle: Vehicle {
    let numberOfWheels = 2
}

struct Car: Vehicle {
    let numberOfWheels = 4
}
```

_Rationale:_ Value types are simpler, easier to reason about, and behave as expected with the `let` keyword.

#### Make classes `final` by default

Classes should start as `final`, and only be changed to allow subclassing if a valid need for inheritance has been identified. Even in that case, as many definitions as possible _within_ the class should be `final` as well, following the same rules.

_Rationale:_ Composition is usually preferable to inheritance, and opting _in_ to inheritance hopefully means that more thought will be put into the decision.


#### Omit type parameters where possible

Methods of parameterized types can omit type parameters on the receiving type when they’re identical to the receiver’s. For example:

```swift
struct Composite<T> {
	…
	func compose(other: Composite<T>) -> Composite<T> {
		return Composite<T>(self, other)
	}
}
```

could be rendered as:

```swift
struct Composite<T> {
	…
	func compose(other: Composite) -> Composite {
		return Composite(self, other)
	}
}
```

_Rationale:_ Omitting redundant type parameters clarifies the intent, and makes it obvious by contrast when the returned type takes different type parameters.

#### Using trailing closures when appropriate

If a method or function call takes a closure as an argument, use Swift's trailing closure syntax to make it harder to lose that closing parenthesis:

```swift
dispatch_async(dispatch_get_main_queue()) {
  completionHandler(success, error)
}
```

On the other hand, if a method or function call takes _more than one_ closure as an argument, avoid trailing closure syntax since you'll only confuse yourself.

```swift
UIView.animateWithDuration(1.0, animations: {
  // Animation code
}, completion: {
  finish in
  // Completion handler code
})
```
